# Simulation
The simulation window provides a solution to test your conversation flows.
Upon starting the simulation, the given inputs will be send to the Conversation Engine and the results will be captured.

# Viewing the simulation results
The captured results will be displayed with your own created dialog model.
The active state will be highlighted and the transition used to get to the current state.
You can move the dialog model while holding down the right mouse button.

# Navigating between the result steps
To view the single result steps, you have multiple navigation buttons at the top of the window.
You can view each step one by one or jump directly to the end or the beginning.
In addition you can press the play button to display each step automatically after a short delay.
To change the delay between each step you can add a speed value in the designated input field.

# Viewing the conversation messages
At the bottom of the window you will find two separated outputs.
The left output displays the conversation messages for every step to the one currently analysed.
The user messages will be displayed in green and on the left hand side.
The Bot's messages will be displayed at the right side in a purple color.

# Viewing the logging messages
The right output at the bottom of the window will display the logging messages for each step.
It will display all messages fitting the chosen logging level inside the simulation settings
